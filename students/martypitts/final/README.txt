Chris & Maria: 

Thanks for the help this quarter. I enjoyed the class and have learned a ton.

1) When I run py.test I get errors where the standard input is querried. I would like to know how to force pytest to
drive the standard input to BudgetApp so I do not need to repeat entering all the budget data.
Can you help with a few unit tests to provide an example?

2) How would you structure the code to limit all the print statements such that I can customize the code
in one location for a better (cleaner) querry for the user?

3) What suggestions would you make to improve the code? 

Thanks,

Marty
